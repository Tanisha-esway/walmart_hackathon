According to my understanding of the problem statement the problem was of data regarding data analysis. So I analysed the data deeply and came up with a simple greedy approach in which we sorted data based on maximum difference in quantity of quantity 1 an base quantity. We choose quantity1 only becausew we observed that the difference in quantity2-quantity1 and quantity3-quantity2 etc we close enough. And thn for each item we chose the price with smallest quantity difference among the 4 quantity difference(i.e. quantity1-baseunits, quantity2-quantity1, quantity3-quantity2, quantity4-quantity3).
